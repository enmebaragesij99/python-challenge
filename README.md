# python-challenge
This is my Module 3: python-challenge which consists of my PyPoll and PyBank python files with both outputs of prints(within the terminal) and text files. 
Ran out of time and had trouble downloading the repository so therefore I added everythiong manually.
Note; when i encountered issues within my code I received help from my tutor and useful resources such as stackoverflow.
