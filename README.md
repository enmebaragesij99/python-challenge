# python-challenge
This is my Module 3: python-challenge which consists of two folders:PyPoll and PyBank folders, which include my main.py python code, a resources folder with the csv data set and a analysis fodler with my output.txt file
Ran out of time and had trouble cloning the repository(pushing and pulling etc.),therefore, I added everythiong manually to the repository(hopefully it sitll works).
Files work and run on my computer through my Resources file, not to sure if it will run through git hub seeing as I have added everything manually.

Note; when i encountered issues within my code I received help from my tutor and useful resources such as stackoverflow.
